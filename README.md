# CEG 4110 Homework 1: Text Color and Drawing Android App

This is a simple app which contains two functions:
1. Randomly change the color of text, and display both the hex and rgb values
2. Make a drawing, optionally with different colors, and save or share it

# Development

This project was written in Kotlin, for educational purposes. I'm already pretty familiar with Java, and have wanted to learn Kotlin for a while, thus I decided this would be a good opportunity to force myself to use it.
